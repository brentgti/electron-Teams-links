# electron-teams-links

**Clone and run for a quick way to see Electron in action.**

This is a minimal Electron application based on the [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.

The application runs in the System Tray (look for the MS Teams icon). Right click on the icon to select the Teams link to which you want to navigate. 

## To Use

Clone this repository and run "npm start" from the main directory or create an exe by following the instructions here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-packager

## To Do

* Have the app read links from a user editable file (currently they're hard coded) or allow them to be entered right in the app.
* Use left click on tray icon instead of (or in addition to) right click. 
* Move script code out of index.html, into a separate file.
